# Comparison-of-the-prognostic-properties-of-the-model-estimated-by-OLS-and-non-parametric-regression
Compare the properties based on the data
prognostic model estimated by means of OLS and nonparametric regression. Comparison
Please perform the prognostic properties using a ùëò-fold cross-validation.

- description of variables: descriptive statistics, box plots, test of normality of distribution, plot of density estimators
decomposition obtained using three different nuclei.
- description of models estimated with the OLS separately for each potential explanatory variable
separately (based on all data). The description includes a graph, a presentation of possible data transformations (so that the studied dependence can be estimated using
using LSM), the results of estimation and measures of model fit.
- presentation of the results of nonparametric regression estimation performed for each variable
explanatory statement on the basis of the entire data set. The description includes a measure of the fit and a presentation of the dependencies, a chart.
For the explanatory variable for which, using the LSM, the model with the highest coefficient was obtained
determination, the prognostic properties of the parametric and regression models are compared
nonparametric. In order to evaluate these properties, it is used
k-fold cross validation.
